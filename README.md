# üåç Project Title: [Reusing Decommissioned Aircrafts to Jump Start Launch Capabilities to Low Earth Orbit]
**Team:** Youth Orbit 
**Event:** NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025  
**Challenge:** Commercializing Low Earth Orbit

A demo for Nasa Space Apps which includes a simulation of an air-launch platform traversing to their altitude and drop a rocket to deliver a payload to Low Earth Orbit.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Overview
Youth Orbit presents a concept to commercialize Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using repurposed aircraft as air-launch platforms.
This demo showcases a flight and launch simulation, visualized on an interactive 3D globe powered by Cesium Ion, to demonstrate how an aircraft-based system can efficiently deliver small payloads into orbit.

The simulation models the aircraft‚Äôs takeoff, flight path, launch release, and return trajectory, providing an intuitive visualization of how such a scalable and sustainable LEO access method could work.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Features
- Realistic 3D visualization of an aircraft performing an air launch.
- Simulated flight trajectory including ascent, payload release, and return.
- Designed for scalability and feasibility studies in future commercial LEO operations.
- Runs directly in the browser ‚Äî no installation required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 3D Visualization: CesiumJS
- Data: Static flight trajectory data (JSON) generated via Python
- Deployment: GitHub Pages (linked to a GoDaddy domain)

The Python script generates position and altitude data points that define the aircraft‚Äôs route. These are then visualized using CesiumJS to illustrate the launch trajectory in near-real-time simulation.
